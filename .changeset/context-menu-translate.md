feat: add context menu translate option

Add right-click context menu option for translating pages directly from the browser context menu.

**Important**: This feature requires a new `contextMenus` permission. When upgrading, your browser may prompt you to approve this new permission and temporarily disable the extension until approved. This is normal browser behavior for permission changes.
