# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Read Frog is an open-source AI-powered language learning browser extension that provides immersive translation, article analysis, and contextual learning features.

## Design Principles

- **SOLID**
  - **S**ingle Responsibility: one reason to change per unit.
  - **O**pen/Closed: extend via **composition**; avoid modifying stable core.
  - **L**iskov: subtypes must be true drop-ins.
  - **I**nterface Segregation: small, focused interfaces.
  - **D**ependency Inversion: depend on abstractions; wire via DI.

- **DRY, KISS, YAGNI**
  - No duplication; simplest thing that could work; don’t build for imaginary futures.

- **Functional Lean**
  - Prefer **pure functions**, **immutability**, and **clear boundaries** (ports & adapters / hexagonal).

## Requirements Confirmation Process

Whenever users express demands, must follow these steps:

1. **Thinking Prerequisites - Linus's Three Questions**

Before starting any analysis, ask yourself:

```text
1. "Is this a real problem or an imagined one?" - Reject over-engineering
2. "Is there a simpler way?" - Always seek the simplest solution
3. "Will it break anything?" - Backward compatibility is an iron law
```

2. **Requirements Understanding Confirmation**

```text
Based on existing information, I understand your requirement is: [Restate requirement using Linus's thinking communication style]
Please confirm if my understanding is accurate?
```

2. **Linus-style Problem Decomposition Thinking**

   **Layer 1: Data Structure Analysis**

```text
"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures."

- What is the core data? How are they related?
- Where does the data flow? Who owns it? Who modifies it?
- Are there unnecessary data copying or transformations?
```

**Layer 2: Special Case Identification**

```text
"Good code has no special cases"

- Find all if/else branches
- Which are real business logic? Which are patches for bad design?
- Can we redesign data structures to eliminate these branches?
```

**Layer 3: Complexity Review**

```text
"If implementation requires more than 3 levels of indentation, redesign it"

- What is the essence of this feature? (Explain in one sentence)
- How many concepts does the current solution use?
- Can we reduce it to half? Half again?
```

**Layer 4: Destructive Analysis**

```text
"Never break userspace" - Backward compatibility is an iron law

- List all existing features that might be affected
- Which dependencies will be broken?
- How to improve without breaking anything?
```

**Layer 5: Practicality Verification**

```text
"Theory and practice sometimes clash. Theory loses. Every single time."

- Does this problem really exist in production?
- How many users actually encounter this problem?
- Does the complexity of the solution match the severity of the problem?
```

3. **Decision Output Pattern**

After the above 5 layers of thinking, output must include (format can be prettier align with markdown of Github):

```text
【Core Judgment】
✅ Worth doing: [reason] / ❌ Not worth doing: [reason]

【Key Insights】
- Data structure: [most critical data relationships]
- Complexity: [complexity that can be eliminated]
- Risk points: [biggest destructive risks]

【Linus-style Solution】
If worth doing:
1. First step is always to simplify data structures
2. Eliminate all special cases
3. Implement in the stupidest but clearest way
4. Ensure zero destructiveness

If not worth doing:
"This is solving a non-existent problem. The real problem is [XXX]."
```

4. **Code Review Output**

When seeing code, immediately make three-layer judgment:

```text
【Taste Score】
🟢 Good taste / 🟡 Acceptable / 🔴 Poor quality

【Fatal Issues】
- [If any, directly point out the worst parts]

【Improvement Direction】
"Eliminate this special case"
"These 10 lines can become 3 lines"
"Data structure is wrong, should be..."
```

## Development Commands

### Core Development

```bash
# Start development mode (Chrome)
pnpm dev

# Start development with local monorepo packages
pnpm dev:local
```

### Testing and Quality

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:cov

# Type checking
pnpm type-check

# Linting
pnpm lint
pnpm lint:fix
```

## Architecture

### Extension Structure

The extension follows WXT's entrypoints pattern:

- **`src/entrypoints/background/`** - Background service worker
  - Handles extension lifecycle, message routing, proxy fetch
  - Manages translation queues, database cleanup, config backup
  - Coordinates between content scripts and popup

- **`src/entrypoints/*.content/`** - Content scripts injected into web pages
  - `host.content` - Main article reading and analysis UI
  - `selection.content` - Selection translation popup
  - `side.content` - Side panel interface
  - `guide.content` - Onboarding guide overlay

- **`src/entrypoints/popup/`** - Extension popup UI
- **`src/entrypoints/options/`** - Settings page (multi-page React app)

### Extension Config Migration

When changing the schema of the config, you need to add a migration script to the `src/utils/config/migration-scripts` directory, update the `CONFIG_SCHEMA_VERSION` constant and write examples for testing migration scripts.

### State Management Architecture

Uses Jotai atoms with a custom storage adapter pattern:

- **Config Atom** ([src/utils/atoms/config.ts](src/utils/atoms/config.ts))
  - Single source of truth for extension settings
  - Syncs with browser.storage.local via `storageAdapter`
  - Uses `deepmerge-ts` with array overwrite strategy for updates
  - Watches for changes across extension contexts (popup, content, options)
  - Handles visibility changes to prevent stale config in inactive tabs

- **Storage Adapter** ([src/utils/atoms/storage-adapter.ts](src/utils/atoms/storage-adapter.ts))
  - Abstraction over browser.storage API
  - Provides `get`, `set`, `watch` methods with Zod schema validation
  - Enables reactive state sync across extension contexts

## Important Notes

As AI, you should be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
