## Getting Started

### Step 1: Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine

```bash
# Clone the repository from your fork
git clone https://github.com/xxxxx/read-frog.git

# Enter the project directory
cd read-frog
```

### Step 2: Set up and initialize local database
You can set up any Postgres database of your choice locally. It is recommended to use Supabase local development. Skip step 2.1 if using non-Supabase deployments.

#### Step 2.1: Supabase local deployment
To set up the database required by the project, go to the [Supabase local development set up guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development?queryGroups=package-manager&package-manager=brew)
to create a local Supabase instance for local development. After the step, a new folder `supabase` will be created under the project root. Never commit this folder as it is only for local development.

After initialization, run the following command to check local instance running status:
```bash
supabase status
```
You'll see output like the following:
```
         API URL: http://xxxxxxx
     GraphQL URL: http://xxxxxxx
  S3 Storage URL: http://xxxxxxx
          DB URL: postgresql://xxxxxxx
      Studio URL: http://xxxxxxx
    Inbucket URL: http://xxxxxxx
      JWT secret: xxxxxxx
        anon key: xxxxxxx
service_role key: xxxxxxx
   S3 Access Key: xxxxxxx
   S3 Secret Key: xxxxxxx
       S3 Region: xxxxxxx
```
Note down the value of `DB URL` for use in future steps.

#### Step 2.2: Initialize local database schema
Create a file `.env` under `<project_root>/packages/db/`. In that file, define a variable `DATABASE_URL` and fill in the full database connection URL.
If using Supabase from step 2.1, fill in `DB URL` obtained in that step.

Example `<project_root>/packages/db/.env`:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
```

Then, run the following command to initialize database schemas:
```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

### Step 3: Set up environment
Create a file `.env.local` under `<project_root>/apps/website/`. In that file, define values for all the environment variables declared in `<project_root>/apps/website/env.ts`. In particular:
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: Setting any value is fine. It is being used as seed for encryption.
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: Same as website URL.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google SSO keys. Set with random values if no need to log in locally. Otherwise, apply one on Google.
- `DATABASE_URL`: Complete URL to connect to the Postgres database. If using Supabase from step 2.1, fill in `DB URL` obtained in that step.
- `PUBLIC_REPO_GITHUB_TOKEN`: For displaying Github starred count. (Optional)

Example `<project_root>/apps/website/.env.local`:
```
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<SOME_BETTER_AUTH_SECRET>
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8888

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<SOME_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<SOME_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres

# Optional – only needed if you want the deal with rate limit of Github API
PUBLIC_REPO_GITHUB_TOKEN=<SOME_PUBLIC_REPO_GITHUB_TOKEN>
```

### Step 4: Start dev server
Run the following command to start local development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
After startup, access the main website at: http://localhost:8888/.

<Callout title="Windows environment variable configuration">
  If you are currently in a Windows environment, you need to add a `web-ext.config.ts` file in the `apps/extension` directory to explicitly specify the browser path.  
  ```javascript
  // apps/extension/web-ext.config.ts
  import { defineWebExtConfig } from 'wxt';

  export default defineWebExtConfig({
    binaries: {
        chrome: "path/to/your/chrome.exe",
        firefox: "path/to/your/firefox.exe",
        edge: "path/to/your/edge.exe"
	  }
  });
  ```
</Callout>

<Callout title="pnpm dev can't load the extension automatically">
  If you use Chrome version 137 or higher, you need to download [Chrome for
  Testing](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-for-testing/) for
  development. See
  [details](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/config/browser-startup.html).

## Submitting Code

### Create a new branch

```bash
# For new features
git checkout -b feat/the-feature

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/the-bug

# For docs modify
git checkout -b docs/the-docs
```

### Merge Branch

If the remote main branch gets updated and creates conflicts in our PR, you can resolve it by merging the remote branch in advance
.

```bash 
# Switch to the main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the latest code from upstream
git pull upstream main

# Switch back to your local branch
git checkout docs/xxxx

# Merge the main branch into your local branch
git rebase main

# After manually resolving the conflicts, push the code again
git push origin docs/xxxx
```

<Callout title="Fatal in syncing the upstream repository">
  If you encounter this error while syncing the upstream repository
  ```bash
  fatal: 'upstream' does not appear to be a git repository
  fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
  ```
  Please try to manually add an upstream repository 
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog
  ```
</Callout>

## Generating Pull Request

Before generating a Pull Request, you need to add a changeset

```bash
# Add Changeset
pnpm changeset

# Choose Packages
# Which packages would you like to include?...
[] @read-frog/website
[] @read-frog/extension

# Select a appropriate bump type for above packages
# Which packages should have a major bump? (major)
( ) all packages
  ( ) @read-frog/website@0.1.0
  ( ) @read-frog/extension@0.1.0
# Which packages should have a minor bump? (minor)
( ) all packages
  ( ) @read-frog/website@0.1.0
  ( ) @read-frog/extension@0.1.0
# The following packages will be patch bumped (patch)
( ) all packages
  ( ) @read-frog/website@0.1.0
  ( ) @read-frog/extension@0.1.0

# Commit Summary
Summary >> ....
```

`pnpm changeset` will generate `[uniqId].md` in the `.changeset` file, and the description of this changeset can be adjusted again after the generation is completed.

Then create a Pull Request and wait for it to be merged.

## Commit Convention

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for writing commit messages.

## Set environment variables

To automatically load environment variables while developing the extension, such as API keys for the development environment, you can create a `.env.local` file in the `apps/extension` directory.

```bash
# apps/extension/.env.local
WXT_OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
WXT_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=xxx
WXT_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=xxx
```

## Skip Google API Tests in China

If you are a contributor from mainland China, when you need to push code, use the following command:

```bash
# MAC
SKIP_FREE_API=true git push

# WINDOWS
$env:SKIP_FREE_API='true'
git push
```

Why is this necessary? Because code tests are performed during the push process, but Google's free API is inaccessible in mainland China. This would cause the tests to fail and the push to be rejected. By setting the `SKIP_FREE_API` environment variable, we skip the Google tests.
